NAME
    Test::Roles - test that a class or object performs a role

SYNOPSIS
     use Test::Roles;

     use Foo;
     does_ok(Foo, 'bar');

     my $foo = Foo->new;
     does_ok($foo, 'bar');

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Roles provides a test for classes and object that implement roles
    using the Class::Roles module.

    Test::Roles exports a single function does_ok. does_ok takes two
    required arguments: a class or object and a role which that class or
    object must perform. A third optional argument may be used to provide a
    more specific name of what is being testing (for example 'Test
    customer'). in the absence of this argument, 'the object' will be used
    instead.

    Test::Roles is implemented using Test::Builder, so it's tests integrate
    seamlessly with other test modules such as Test::More and
    Test::Exception.

TODO
    Update once Class::Roles (by chromatic) and Class::Role (another 'trait'
    implementation by Luke Palmer) are merged in the near future.
