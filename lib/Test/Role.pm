=head1 NAME

Test::Roles - test that a class or object performs a role

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::Roles;

 use Foo;
 does_ok(Foo, 'bar');

 my $foo = Foo->new;
 does_ok($foo, 'bar');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Roles provides a test for classes and object that implement roles
using the Class::Roles module.

Test::Roles exports a single function B<does_ok>. B<does_ok> takes two
required arguments: a class or object and a role which that class or object
must perform. A third optional argument may be used to provide a more
specific name of what is being testing (for example 'Test customer'). in the
absence of this argument, 'the object' will be used instead.

Test::Roles is implemented using Test::Builder, so it's tests integrate
seamlessly with other test modules such as Test::More and Test::Exception.

package Bar;

use Class::Roles role => 'bar';

sub bar { 'bar' }

package Foo;

use Class::Roles does => 'bar';

does_ok($foo, 'bar', 'the $foo object');

test_out("ok 1 - the Foo class performs the bar role");
does_ok('Foo', 'bar', 'the Foo class');

Update once Class::Roles (by chromatic) and Class::Role (another 'trait'
implementation by Luke Palmer) are merged in the near future.
